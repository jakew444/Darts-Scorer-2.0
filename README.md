# Darts-Scorer-2.0

Darts Scorer 2.0 is an updated version on my darts scorer basic app. 

This update features a homepage that allow the user to initialise the number of set and legs they want to play as well as what starting score they want to play from.
After user input is selected and the start button is pressed, the user is taken to the gamepage where they can input their turns, the application will prevent users from inputing
invalid scores and will increment the players legs and sets automatically eventually declaring a winner once the players scores allgin with the home-page input parameters selected.

In this project I used SCSS for styling and Javascript for functionality.
